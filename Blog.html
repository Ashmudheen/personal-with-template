                  <p><strong>Smart Homes: When Interior Design Meets the Internet Of Things</strong></p>
                  <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is bringing smart devices into the home – even before you move in. While interior design and technology are concepts that are not usually discussed, the onset of smart home gadgets is leading more designers to incorporate a digital focus on the elements of design. As the market for home interior rapidly grows, the industry is also making larger investments to develop innovative products by adopting IoT, with terms like ‘ITerior’ and “IoT-terior’ into their layout.</p>
                  <p>In fact, over 24 billion digital devices will be connected through IOT by 2020, according to research from Gartner. And while the idea of connecting household appliances like TVs, stoves, and refrigerators to the internet isn’t groundbreaking news, the potential of boosting the home decoration industry with smart technology is fueling IoT growth.</p>
                  <p><strong>Turning Traditional Living Spaces into High-Tech Homes</strong> </p>
                  <p>With today’s busy generation, the demand for smart homes allows individuals to create a flexible work-life balance that’s useful for all ages. For example, the major home furniture and appliance giant, IKEA, recently launched a trendy smart lighting system that connects to tablets and mobile devices. Meanwhile, HiCan developed a smart mattress that combines the elements of entertainment, health management, and connectivity. When wearable tech and cooking appliances are combined, the ability to turn off the stove on your way to work can improve the levels of safety for families.</p>
                  <p><strong>IoT Interior Services</strong></p>
                  <p>Behind the trendy products in home décor, there are services that connect household appliances into an entire home control system. This service allows users to decorate their homes while establishing a new IoT environment. In fact, IoT-equipped homes are able to control heat via smartphone or virtual assistant, switch on/off lights with Wi-Fi, and start the pressure cooker from your smartphone</p>
                  <p>As last year’s major trend in IoT was about security and energy efficiency, 2019 seems to be focusing on the “how” of making your home relaxing through smart decoration. Thus, we can only expect to see how home construction and remodeling will be based on IoT functions in the near future.</p>
                  <p><strong>Improving Your Budget in More Ways than One</strong></p>
                  <p>The Internet of Things will affect how families interact with the space around them as well as what their appliances have to offer. The importance of data that is collected by IoT products can provide a variety of advantages, such as being able to detect when one section of the home is malfunctioning or in need of maintenance. This helps give insurance companies the confidence in your property decisions as well as the value of your home.</p>
                  <p>Not only will incorporating IoT in your home design become affordable, but it may also save you money due to the use of energy-efficient technology. With new attempts of bringing IoT and interior design trends onto the same platform, interior décor will not only provide aesthetics but also offer smart functions that make the home comfortable and convenient. After all, smart homes shouldn’t be “smart” for the sake of it, but to improve the everyday lives of consumers.</p>

                  <p><strong>GitHub starts publishing a public roadmap</strong></p>
                  <p>GitHub today announced that it will start publishing a public roadmap to help its users understand when it will ship new features across its various versions of the GitHub code repository and products like GitHub Actions, its mobile app and its security tools</p>
                  <p>"What we’re trying to do is provide a way for people to see what’s coming, join in that dialogue and give us feedback and be able to collaborate with us,” GitHub’s SVP of Product Shanku Niyogi told me.</p>
                  <p>He also noted that as the company’s enterprise business has grown, the need for customers to be able to prepare for what’s coming next has also increased. Until now, GitHub often provided this information to some of its larger customers directly (through good old slide decks), but that same information will now be available to all. To Niyogi, this is essentially about “building GitHub more the way that people build software on GitHub already.”</p>

                  <p><strong>Movies Anywhere unveils its own Watch Together feature</strong></p>
                  <p>Movies Anywhere, the Disney-owned digital movie locker that recently began allowing users to lend videos to their friends, is going a step further by letting viewers set up remote watch parties.</p>
                  <p>Following in the footsteps of such video streaming services as Hulu and Plex, Movies Anywhere’s new Watch Together feature is compatible with any movie in your Movies Anywhere locker, and it works across all of the service’s various apps, including those for iOS, Android, and smart TVs.</p>
                  <p>Up to nine viewers can join a Movies Anywhere watch party at a time, and those in the group can react to the action with emojis, although (unfortunately) not with text chat. The Watch Together host gets to control movie playback, while guests in the room can request that the host pause, rewind, or fast-forward the video.</p>
                  <p>Up to nine viewers can join a Movies Anywhere watch party at a time, and those in the group can react to the action with emojis, although (unfortunately) not with text chat. The Watch Together host gets to control movie playback, while guests in the room can request that the host pause, rewind, or fast-forward the video.</p>
                  <p>First of all, Watch Together guests will either need to log into their Movies Anywhere accounts or create new ones, and the ratings restriction on their Movies Anywhere profiles must be set to PG-13 or higher.</p>
                  <p>More importantly, you and all your guests must—in one way or another—have access to the Movies Anywhere title you want to co-watch.</p>
                  <p>For example, you and your friends can join a Movies Anywhere watch party if everyone in the group has either purchased the movie through Movies Anywhere or unlocked it via a redemption code (typically from a Blu-ray disc).</p>
                  <p>Another option is to lend a movie to up to three guests using Movies Anywhere’s new Screen Pass feature. Those who receive a Screen Pass will have up to 14 days to access the movie and 72 hours to watch once they press the “play” button. Only “select” Movies Anywhere titles are eligible for the Screen Pass program, however, and for now, the list of ineligible movies include Marvel films and the Star Wars saga.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of Screen Pass, Movies Anyway just announced a new feature that allows Screen Pass recipients to browse the eligible movies in the lender’s collection and pick for themselves the title they’d like to borrow.</p>
                  <p>For those who aren’t aware, Movies Anywhere essentially lets you take your digital movie collection (or most of it anyway—neither Paramount nor Lionsgate participate in Movies Anywhere) to services such as iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, and Vudu, along with any purchased DVD or Blu-ray movies that include digital codes. All you need to do is sign up for a Movies Anywhere account and connect it to your favorite (and participating) digital video retailers.</p>

                  <p><strong>Is cloud gaming the future?</strong></p>
                  <p>It didn’t take long for video games to become a huge cultural force. Now worth roughly double the film industry, gaming is massive – and by its very nature, it needs to stay at the forefront of technology. Alongside advances in graphics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, recent years have seen major developments in cloud gaming.

                    Also known as known as “gaming on demand” or “games as a service”, cloud gaming can be boiled down to the simple idea of applying cloud computing to games. Now, it has the potential to revolutionise the way video games are consumed.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>How cloud gaming works</strong></p>
                    <p>From ZX Spectrums and Commodore 64s to the latest consoles and PC graphics cards, hardware has always been a huge part of gaming. Crucially, this hardware could usually be found sitting on a desk or under a TV. It’s in this sense that cloud gaming is a fundamental shift: instead of running games on a device in the user’s home, cloud-based services do all the processing at another physical location, potentially hundreds of miles away.</p>
                    <p>Of course, cloud gamers still need something to connect to the server. But because there’s no need for on-board gaming capabilities, virtually any internet-enabled device will do, whether it’s a tablet, a laptop or a smart TV. Specialised, low-powered devices or “thin clients” are also available – gaming-optimised streaming boxes that can, in theory, turn any screen into a high-performance games machine.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of this cloud model for gaming? The newest gaming hardware doesn’t come cheap: hundreds of pounds for a console or thousands for a tricked-out PC, plus the games themselves – and with gaming technology constantly evolving, upgrading hardware every few years is mandatory to enjoy the latest titles at their best. By connecting to devices in the cloud, costs are reduced to a subscription fee, and the provider takes on all the responsibilities of maintaining high-end gaming systems. With no need for on-site hardware, cloud gaming also saves space in the home and eliminates the noise and heat generated by gaming machines.</p>
                    <p>At first glance then, gaming on demand is just another aspect of cloud computing in general. Cloud gaming is often described as “Netflix for games”, and there are certainly parallels, with millions of viewers now accessing content on remote servers rather than home DVD players. However, due to the interactive nature of the media, cloud gaming is far more demanding than video streaming.</p>

                  <p><strong>TIOBE Index July: Programming language R climbs up the rankings</strong></p>
                  <p>The July 2020 edition of the TIOBE Index reveals an interesting climb in the popularity of programming language R.</p>
                  <p>R is a statistical language which notably crashed out of the top 20 in TIOBE’s Index for the first time in three years in May.</p>
                  <p>“A possible reason for this is that statistical programming is finding its way from university to industry nowadays, and Python is more accepted by the industry,” TIOBE mulled in May.</p>
                  <p>R has made a remarkable recovery to take 8th place in the rankings, just behind JavaScript and Visual Basic.</p>

                  <p><strong>Amazon Honeycode helps businesses develop apps without code</strong></p>
                  <p>Amazon has announced Honeycode, a new tool which promises to help businesses develop mobile and web apps without coding knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The new tool comes specifically from Amazon Web Services and is designed to help their clients to craft interactive apps using a simple visual builder.</p>
                  <p>Amazon promises Honeycode will enable businesses to “create applications that range in complexity from a task-tracking application for a small team to a project management system that manages a complex workflow for multiple teams or departments.”</p>
                  <p>Users can build applications for up to 20 people for free, but after that they’ll need to pay for each extra individual and the storage their apps use.</p>
                  <p>Customers have told us that the need for custom applications far outstrips the capacity of developers to create them,” said AWS VP Larry Augustin.</p>

                  <p>The security team for the world’s largest repository host has dubbed the malware Octopus Scanner and found “26 open source projects that were backdoored by this malware and that were actively serving backdoored code.”</p>
                  <p>GitHub notes the malware is designed to backdoor projects created using the Apache NetBeans IDE – a phenomenon they had not seen before on their platform.</p>
                  <p>“It was interesting that this malware attacked the NetBeans build process specifically since it is not the most common Java IDE in use today,” GitHub’s security team said in their report on Thursday.

                  <p><strong>New developer tools boost Google Assistant’s capabilities</strong></p>
                  <p>Google has launched new tools for developers which are designed to boost Assistant’s capabilities when responding to user requests.</p>
                  <p>The virtual assistant is regularly found to handle general queries better than its closest competitors, but too often you can think it would just be quicker to do a task yourself. We’re still far off from the sci-fi visions of AI assistants like HAL and JARVIS.</p>
                  <p>Google Assistant, and its rivals, have made large strides in improving areas such as natural language recognition and the ability to somewhat hold a conversation – especially to ask for clarifications – but some work is going to have to come from third-party developers.</p>
